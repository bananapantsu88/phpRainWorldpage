# phpRainWorldpage
A little University project base in one of my favourites videogames of all time, Rain World. It's a fan-page created for me to promote Rain World and myself as a Civil Engineer in informatics and Computing.

The project consist of a main page, an About Us page, and a system of login and sign in.
If you sign in, Your info will be registered in a phpMyAdmin database.
If you login being an admin (that is, only me) you will be redirected to a control panel page where you can administer all the info the users uploaded.
